Explain what each file does? 

Assign1_Q1: Calculate the product of consecutive integers starting from 1 until it exceed the threshold.

Assign1_Q2: Create a dictionary using string from the  list as keys. For each key, it contains the length of the string and parity determine whether the length is even or odd.

Assign1_Q3: Compute x**y for each pair of (x,y) in the given list where y is positive. Print out a new list of computed results.

Assign1_Q4: Generate a list of 20 random number between 0 and 1 and generate a random value for x (from 0 to 1). Sort the list and find all indices of values in the list that are greater than or equal to x. Print the sorted list, the value of x and the first value's index that greater than or equal to x.

Assign1_Q5: Ask the user for input of two circles's radius, validate and display appropriate error message for negative and non integer numbers. Calculate areas of both circles and converage percentage of smaller circle to larger one. 

Assign1_Q6: Create a dictionary that take numbers in the list as keys, make sure each key is unique. For each key, calculate the percentage of values in the list that are less than or equal to each key. Return the dictionary with sorted keys with corresponding percentage. 

Assign1_Q7: Ask the user for input of number of seconds. Validate the input and display appropriate error message for negative value. Start from midnight, converting seconds to hours, minute and determine whether it is AM or PM. Return a formatted string that contains number of hours, minutes, seconds and AM or PM.
